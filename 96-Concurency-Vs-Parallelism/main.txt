Concurrency VS Parallelism

--> Concurrency doesn't guarantee that tasks will run in true parallel

Concurrency
------------
--> It is about structuring your program in a way that allows multiple tasks to be executed concurrently, often to improve efficiency and responsiveness.
Parallelism 
-----------
--> It is about executing multiple tasks simultaneously, leveraging multiple processors or cores to speed up computation.
